# css-integration-challenge
In this exercise, you will build a full integration step by step. As often with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

For each interface :

- Create a standard html page.
- Create a standard style.css sheet
- Add the relevant html and css code so that the end result looks exactly as the provided high-fidelity mockup images.

## Interface 1
Create the view pixel-perfectly. Make it responsive: the grid should stack on small screens.
